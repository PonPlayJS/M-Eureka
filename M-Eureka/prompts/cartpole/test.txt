Generate a custom Python reward function for the CartPole-v1 environment.
The function should penalize the agent if the pole's angle deviates too much from the vertical,
and reward it if it keeps the pole balanced for longer.
Provide ONLY the Python code for the function, without additional explanations, not even the "```"`
additionally, it must have a similar format to this (but hopefully much better):

def custom_reward(observation): # can only have observation, otherwise it gives an error
    angle = observation[2]
    x_pos = observation[0]
    reward = 1.0
    
    # Penalty for excessive angle (scaled with the angle)
    angle_penalty = min(max(abs(angle) * 5, 0), 2)
    reward -= angle_penalty
    
    # Penalty for extreme horizontal deviation
    if abs(x_pos) > 2.4:
        reward -= 2.0
    
    # Bonus for keeping the pole near vertical
    if abs(angle) < 0.1:
        reward += 0.5
    
    # Survival bonus (increases over time)
    reward += 0.01
    
    return float(reward)
